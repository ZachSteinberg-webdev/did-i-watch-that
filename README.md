Have you ever sat down to watch a TV show but you can't remember where you left off? You know you were in season 3 of that killer comedy or edge-of-your-seat drama, but you aren't sure which episode you last watched. Then you take a guess and launch a random episode. Nope! That's not it. You've already seen that one. Or worse, you get an unwanted preview of an episode you haven't watched yet. Spoiler alert! Well, search no more. Simply keep Did I Watch That?!?! open on your phone, tablet or computer when you watch TV shows, and mark each episode off as you watch it. Never guess again!

I'm not much of a movie watcher, but I absolutely love watching all sorts of TV shows. Often, I'll take a break from a show for a few days or more, and when I come back to it, I can't remember where I left off. So, I built this web application to solve that problem.

This was a really exciting build for me, again making use of the React framework, and additionally gave me some good experience working with an external, 3rd party API to retrive different types of data, sanitize it and use it.

Many thanks to the wonderful folks at TV Maze (https://tvmaze.com) for making their API available for free for small projects!
